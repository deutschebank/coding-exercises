# Deutsche Bank coding exercises

When you are visiting this repository you might be considering an engagement as engineer at Deutsche Bank or even already have applied for a position at [careers.db.com](https://careers.db.com).

Thank's for your interest!

This repository contains coding exercises and example projects that we use in our recruitment process. We believe that this is a fair and reliable way for us to make sure that we hire the best talent and for you to find the right job at Deutsche Bank.

## How it works

The coding exercise usually will take place after you had initial converstations with the team that is hiring. The recruiting engineer will agree with you on the right exercise for the position. We basically have two types of exercises:

1. **Code submission** - You are asked to implement your own solution for one of the exercises before the interview. During the interview you will walk through your solution with our engineer and explain, discuss and further develop. See below for options [how to submit your code](#how-to-submit-your-code).

2. **Live coding** - No upfront submission is required, you just familiarize with the example project. During the interview you will be presented some requirements and develop a solution on-the-fly while sharing your screen with our engineer.

In either case you will be granted sufficient lead time to prepare for the interview session which will then take between 60 and 90 minutes. During the session you can use assistive tools that are also available to our engineers, e.g. an internet search engine.

## How to submit your code

To share your code with us you either can

- create a fork, push changes to a branch on your fork and share the link with our engineer. Note that this generates a publicly visible link between your personal and our original repository.
- clone the repository, push your changes into your personal repository on Github and share the link with our engineer.
- clone the repository, make changes locally and share them via screen sharing during the interview.

Please note that we will not accept any pull requests on the repository.
