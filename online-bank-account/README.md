# Online Bank Account

This project contains the skeleton of a simple online banking application. To be fair, it doesn't provide any interesting features yet. That's where you come into the game. You will be asked to add some features to the application.

The specific tasks will be presented to you by our interviewer.

## Prerequisites

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
